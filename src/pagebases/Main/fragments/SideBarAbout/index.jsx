        Hi! Yusril here, it's been a blast making this site. Solely working from singular static
        design was a good challenge for me in trying to make something nice. I do encounter multiple
        problems here and there. With Safari being Safari, Chromium battling against Firefox, etc.

        I hope whoever you are reviewing this site is hyped as I'm in the making. It isn't perfect,
        there is a flaw here and there. But I decided to pat myself on the back for doing all of the
        planning and execution in three days. It definitely could be better, but this was a good
        run. Thank you for the challenge, and I hope we can meet soon following the application ðŸ‘‹.
